    <h3 class="article"> How to do your bills </h3>
    <p class="articleText"> So you want to learn about bills.
<br><br>
You know when you use water, electricity, and gas? Yeah, you get charged for doing that. <br>Bills will come to your door regularly so be aware of that and make sure you don’t mistakenly throw them out!
<br><br>
The time that they come depends on the kind of method you pay with and for how often you pay.<br> Electricity and water bills usually come every month or so. Some bills may come bimonthly or Going back to the method part, there are different types of ways that you can pay your bills. <br>For example, you can mail your payment, or pay it in person. If you don’t like to be pressured into paying, you can make an account online to charge directly to your bank account.
<br><br>
Before you receive your bills you should plan ahead. Estimate how much you need to pay for water, electricity, gas, etc. <br>Just in case you might be short on cash/ credit, you can plan ahead and check to see if you have sufficient funds.
<br><br>
When you receive your bills, you should organize them into categories. This helps in managing the due date and whether you can afford to pay for it or not.<br> More importantly, it keeps them in a safe space so you can avoid losing or misplacing them.
<br><br>
If you’re short on cash, make sure you pay for your important necessities first. Making that a priority over anything else ensures you to stay healthy.<br> Maybe for the next month, you can cut down spending on inessential things like jewelry or that new pair of shoes that just came out. <br>You can also negotiate surrounding your due date so you won’t be overdue for it.
<br><br>
Now you know everything about bills! So make sure you pay them on time and don’t go in debt!
