    <h3 class="article"> Helpful tips for building a resume and interviewing: </h3>
    <p class="articleText"> To begin, a basic resume is comprised of four basic elements: your summary statement, a skills section, your experience or "work history", and an education section. The resume overall should not exceed a page and the font should be clear and readable (a popular one being Times New Roman size 12 font).
The summary Statement should comprise of your full name and your contact information be it your email, phone number, or address. <br>
<br>Once that is done, you will have a small skills section that shows your unique talents. Make sure that those talents are relevant to the job you are applying to as this section should be short and to the point. Many employers use a system called ATS; this means that they will use the words in your skills section to find possible applicants for specific jobs.
<br>Your experience section is one of the most important parts to your resume as this is where you want to show that you are qualified to hold a position similar to the job you are applying to. In most cases, putting volunteering events or charity work should not be including in this sections or sometimes at all. Therefore, make sure to keep the information relevant and within each listed job, and include the date that you worked and a short sentence about what you did while you were there.
<br>Your education section is also very important and should be structured in such a way that employers are able to see your highest degree first and it continues in descending order. This most likely means that it will also be in chronological order. It is assumed that you graduated from High School if you have a higher degree so leave that out. In each event list your year of graduation and if your GPA is something you're proud of list it aswell
</p>
 <br><br>
 <ul>
   <li>Do research on the company you are interviewing for before you go. Make sure to know the position you are applying for inside and out
</li>
<li>Review common interview questions and prepare responses for each. People like to see that you know your stuff so take some of what you've researched and add some </li>
<li>Dress for Success! Make sure you are wearing something that fits the organization's culture whether that be a suit and tie or a stylish tee shirt.</li>
<li>Arrive on time! Interviewers may have many people lined up so if you miss your interview not only is a poor reflection on you, it may also mean that you won't be interviewed at all!
</li>
<li>Make a good first impression. A strong firm handshake and a nice introduction is always a good way to start an interview.
</li>
<li>Even if you're not, act as if you are confident in whatever you are saying. Make sure that your answers are concise and you deliver them with the way you wish to present yourself.
</li>
<li>Body Language in an interview is very important. Make sure to be "open" and have your shoulders back and you maintain proper eye contact.
</li>
<li>Make sure to ask questions. This is where your research comes in handy. Interviewers like to see that you are not only a good worker but you are also interested in the company.
</li>
<li>Sell yourself! Most of the times the most qualified candidate is not the one who gets hired. In fact, it is the person who answered the interview questions the best and presented themselves as a better fit for the company.
</li>
<li>Make sure to thank the interviewer as courtesy goes a long way in an interview. This can be either in the form of email, in person, or on the phone.
</li>
